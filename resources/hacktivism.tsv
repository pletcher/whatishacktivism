Hacktivism, according to information security researcher Dorothy Denning, is "the marriage of hacking and activism." More precisely, it is the use of computer technology to achieve a political agenda through legally ambiguous means. Acts of hacktivism generally obstruct normal computer activity in some way, and does not cause injury or significant monetary loss.	https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/2010-11/Hacktivism/what.html

Hacktivism is a social or political activist plan that is carried out by breaking into and wreaking havoc on a secure computer system. Hacktivism is usually directed at corporate or government targets.	https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hacktivism.asp

In Internet activism, hacktivism or hactivism (a portmanteau of hack and activism) is the subversive use of computers and computer networks to promote a political agenda or a social change. With roots in hacker culture and hacker ethics, its ends are often related to the free speech, human rights, or freedom of information movements.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism

The intention here was clear: an attempt to defend the traditional, less sinister understanding of hacktivism and perhaps broaden it a bit, adding some positive affect to boot; more specifically, that hacking is fundamentally about refusing to be intimidated or cowed into submission by any technology, about understanding the technology and acquiring the power to repurpose it to our individual needs, and for the good of the many. Moreover, they were saying that a true hacktivist doesn’t favor new technology over old — what is critical is that the technologies be in our hands rather than out of our control. This ideal, theoretically, should extend to beyond computer use, to technologies for food production, shelter and clothing, and of course, to all the means we use to communicate with one another.	https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/what-is-a-hacktivist/

Simply stated, it is the subversive use of computers and computer networks to promote a political or social agenda.	https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/the-dramatic-rise-in-hacktivism/

First coined in the mid-90s by Omega, a member of an early hacker collective known as the Cult of the Dead Cow, hacktivism refers to the use of computer hacking to achieve political and sociological goals. It takes many forms and is used by individuals and groups of many different beliefs and ideologies.	http://www.itpro.co.uk/hacking/30203/what-is-hacktivism

With technology advancing these and some people viewing technology as almost a human right couldn’t you argue that hacktivism is encroaching on human rights #ufdigital	https://twitter.com/jacobotter2/status/974442768356593664

I feel that while computer hacking, in general, is bad and disruptive...hacktivism doesn't feel all that bad. It is strongly being an activist for a certain cause and using the web to make a political or social change. @medjesky #ufdigital	https://twitter.com/jacobotter2/status/974442768356593664

Hacktivism is still hacking though. I think it is difficult because we may not thing hacktivism is bad if we agree with their motives, but what if we disagree? Where do we draw the line? #ufdigital	https://twitter.com/ufjoshr/status/973970402040008704

"It is helpful to examine current theories both of hacking and of hacktivism, or the nonviolent use of digital tools in pursuit of political ends" #ActSlackHack1102	https://twitter.com/jamila_sawyerr/status/968935226108936192

Hacktivism is in politics, and it's not all bad. It can be "a form of civil disobedience to promote free and open software, privacy, free speech, freedom of movement, governmental transparency, political self- determination, environmental protection, & other causes."	https://twitter.com/dibenc8740/status/968913908563169281
